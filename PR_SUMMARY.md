# Pull Request Summary

## Features Implemented

This PR implements two major features for the Tuna Quiz Game as requested:

### 1. ðŸ“¤ Bulk Question Upload for Admin Panel

**What it does:**
- Adds a new "Bulk Upload" tab in the admin panel
- Allows admins to paste JSON text or upload .json files
- Validates and imports multiple questions at once
- Provides detailed error messages and success feedback

**Benefits:**
- Saves time when setting up new question banks
- Reduces data entry errors
- Makes it easy to share question sets between administrators
- Supports both text paste and file upload workflows

**Example JSON:**
```json
[
  {
    "question": "What is the capital of France?",
    "options": ["London", "Paris", "Berlin", "Madrid"],
    "answer": "B"
  }
]
```

### 2. ðŸŽ® Practice Mode for Struggling Players

**What it does:**
- Automatically detects when players are struggling
- Offers a practice mode with slower snake speed
- Tracks performance without recording to leaderboard
- Doesn't count toward level unlocking

**Detection Algorithm:**
The system analyzes the last 3 games and looks for patterns:
- Dying very early (< 10 seconds)
- Hitting self when snake is still short
- Long periods without moving the snake
- Not progressing in levels

If 2 out of 3 recent games show struggling patterns (2+ indicators each), the practice mode popup appears.

**Practice Mode Benefits:**
- 80ms slower snake speed for better reaction time
- No pressure from leaderboard competition
- Learn controls and strategy at own pace
- Clear visual indicator when in practice mode

## How to Test

### Bulk Upload Feature
1. Log in as admin
2. Open Admin Panel â†’ Bulk Upload tab
3. Paste the example JSON from `/tmp/test-questions.json` or BULK_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md
4. Click "Upload Questions"
5. Verify success message and question count

**Test invalid data:**
- Invalid JSON syntax
- Missing required fields
- Wrong number of options
- Invalid answer letters

### Practice Mode Feature
1. Log in as a player
2. Play 2-3 very short games (die within 5-10 seconds each)
3. After the 3rd game, practice mode popup should appear
4. Accept practice mode
5. Start new game with 'S'
6. Verify:
   - Orange "PRACTICE MODE" banner appears
   - Snake moves noticeably slower
   - Score not saved to leaderboard after dying

**Test normal play:**
- Play well (survive 30+ seconds, reach level 3+)
- Popup should NOT appear
